                    My name is Julie Wilson, and I am molecular geneticist looking to transition into the world of web development. As a scientist, I have learned to hone a variety of resources and to pay attention to small details that can have a huge impact on the results of a project.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am a Georgia Institute of Technology alumna, and after graduating with a bachelor's of science in biology and research, I began working a number of jobs, including Zoo Atlanta Education Instructor and a molecular neuroscience lab coordinator. These were exciting opportunities that allowed me to really see the field from a variety of angles. I found, however, that working with live animals was not all I had hoped for. While I love to spoil pets at home, the requirements of my jobs pushed me into roles where I felt I could not serve the animals as I would have liked to.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While looking into other fields, I found that I could enjoy animals in my free time while still pursuing fulfilling work. I spoke with friends and family about potential careers, and was inspired my my friend-gone-coder, Katie, as well as my partner and his coworkers in the field. Amidst the many forms that coding can take on, I felt that web design allowed for the most creative outlet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I researched a number of education paths, and felt that a boot camp would really help me to break into the field. I am now  enrolled in Georgia Institute of Technology's Coding Boot Camp cohort graduating February 2018. I am very excited about this program, because Georgia Tech is known for its rigorous coding programs. By the end of this program, I hope to have all the skills necessary to successfully transition into the title of full-stack web developer.
